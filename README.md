# RSS Generator

This is a Proof Of Concept (PoC) of a RSS generator using **Codespaces**, **Github Actions**, and **python**.

## What is a RSS?

RSS, which stands for **Really Simple Syndication** (or Rich Site Summary), is a type of web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to online content in a standardized, computer-readable format. These feeds can include full or summarized text, along with metadata such as publishing dates and authorship.

RSS feeds benefit both publishers and consumers of content. 

- **For publishers**: RSS feeds enable them to syndicate their content automatically, making it easier to distribute and share their updates with a broader audience.
- **For consumers**: RSS feeds provide a convenient way to aggregate updates from multiple sources into a single location, such as an RSS reader app or website, without the need to visit each site individually.
